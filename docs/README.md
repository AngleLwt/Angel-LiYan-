The angel will choose to abandon you for everyone, and the devil will fight against the whole world for you

　What I have observed is that most people impose their own limits。 They limit their output based on self-framed constraints of their capabilities and strengths。 Sometimes these boundaries are based on past experiences。 Sometimes they are based on perceived capacities。 Sometimes these limits are based on nothing。
